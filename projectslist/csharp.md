Here I have compiled all of the many C# projects I have created and finished to an extent.

Many of these projects were ofcourse schoolwork but I added my little touch to all of 
them to get a bit more of a challenge and add that small detail noone really asked for. 

## Main Menu Design

[Github](https://github.com/EricTalv/Main-Menu-Example-1)

This is my prized possesion.

Our course rarely focused on software design which frustrated me, 
since most of the times the UX would be immensly lackluster and dull.

So I decided to create my own intuitive main menu design.

The beauty doesnt inheritly lie in its colors and well the "Design" aspect,
rather the beauty is in the layout and the user experience.

It is very simple to choose a category and see what exactly 
is available in them, and additionally a description of what exactly is talked about.

This allowed me to categorize many of my projects and add more meaning to them, 
not just throw them in an archive folder as many do.

## Hangman Game

[Github](https://github.com/EricTalv/HangManGame)

This is was a fun project.

The task was to create a simple hangman game, that would read word from
your given file and generate a Hangman type of game.

## Dynamic Button creation environment 

[Github](https://github.com/EricTalv/ButtonCreation)

One day I was extremely fed up with dynamically adding elements
to the software load screen, so I decided to create my own button adding environment.

This was all for myself, so I could simplify and understand
how elements would be placed with different methods. 

## Piture Altering

[Github](https://github.com/EricTalv/PictureAltering)

The task was to create a program that would take an image and 
alter it in specific ways.

I looked at many different approaches of altering images, such as 
converting the image into a diamond shape, circle and triangle.


## SinCos Graphical Studying

[Github](https://github.com/EricTalv/SinCosSearch)

This was just a graphical environment for
working with the "sin" and "cos" functions in C#


## Software Graphics studies

[Github](https://github.com/EricTalv/GraphTesting)

Here we tried out different methods on drawing graphical elements in software.

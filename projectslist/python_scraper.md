This was a client requested program I had to make 
at my internship.

The request was pretty much to make a very
elaborate and verbose web-scraper.

I initially created this application on C# but 
really quickly found out the amount of rules
I had to create in order to make it work on C#,
C# just wasnt cut out for the job.

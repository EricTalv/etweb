ChatCenter is my ambitious project in creating an elaborate socialising platform
with many different types of features.

## Inspiration

I got inspired by the website called Omegle.com, basically the idea of 
just chatting to strangers in an environment which is 
somewhat controlled and safe.

Pretty much going against what mom told us 
and still chatting to strangers.

What really inspired me was what omegle was missing.

You pretty much only have 2 features, with an interface 
thats way behind its time and clearly a lacking 
proper development team, the site requires a serious revamp 
and definitely some extra features.

Thus was my project called "ChatCenter"- born.

## How would it differ? 

I've always had an interest towards telemetry and web communications,
have you ever wondered how ALL of this actually works? 
How you can send a message in the matter of milliseconds to someone
on the other side of the earth?

Well curiousity of how it works is one thing, in my case, 
my curiosity developed into something more, specifically:

How far can we push it?

How far could we push our communication methods and what fun and 
exciting things we could manage to do with it.

I had many different features in planned for the website, ranging from
a visual game like area to other maybe not so practical features.

## Along the way


I added this section because my Ideas tend to start as small
yarn balls and end up bigger and bigger within moments.

Though my ambitious project initially revolved around web communication,
I decided that I reaaally wanted to have an admin panel, a blog, an easy development environment.

Basically, since I have a somewhat of a control freak mindset, 
I wanted all the customizability that I neede, so in the future
It would be much easier to push in a feature from the admin panel,
than just diving into the code to write it.

This was waaay out of my boundries of knowledge, I was 
basically about to create my own type of CMS, so I decided
Ill just add a blogging feature where I can update whats happening 
on the site, and add a neat little markdown admin panel where I
can manage my posts.

Though that wasn't easier, It still took a huge load of time.

So basically I ended up with kind of two projects:

 1. Create a feature packed socialising website 

 2. Create an easily managable blogging platform


Well long story short, I got as far as adding posts and 
retrieving them from the database, but my socialising part never
went as far from my Express prototype 

## The future

I definitely still want to work on the product, but right now
I feel like I don't have the the amount of vocabulary that 
I would need to create such a project.

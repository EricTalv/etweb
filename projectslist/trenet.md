I was requested to redo Trenet.eu's website design.

Though the site isn't deployed right now, mostly
due to some administration issues on their server side right now.

This was a great learning area for re-designing some old 
logo files to svg files and migrating the whole system to a much
more simpler static website solution.

The website had to be dumb-proof, as in, anyone could add
new changes simply and easily and also the request was 
to make a safer and less resource hogging website, so a static
website solution was the best option to go with.

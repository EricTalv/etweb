Welcome to my page!

This page was developed over only a couple of days.
The website went through many iterations and design changes,
and thanks to many environmental issues I wasn't as able to create
the astonishing site everyone adores.

BUT I assure the beauty lies more in the process of creation
than the websites desing itself.

So let me bring you through a brief history of 
my portfolio site here 

## Etweb_X

I had recently gotten out of the military and since
there was a very lengthy hiatus from programming, I decided
to take it on myself to make a full-fledged website myself.

Yeah I could've really just taken any web template,
filled it out and settled with that, though I feard
my knowledge has fallen short so this would be a great opportunity to 
refresh myself 

### Etweb 1-2

So here is where it started,
I already have some background in working with vue
so I decided this is what I was gonna go with.

Along the way I picked up some other cool new tech
related things that I wanted to look into such as surge.sh, PWA's and SPA's 

So not only was I just working on a simple Portfolio site,
i was asynchronously looking into PWA's, SEO's and 
other domain-level features.

Here there was some simple design work, I 
ofcourse went with bootstrap for my css library since
I am somewhat familiar with it 


### Etweb 3-4

Here I found out that I also used Nuxt so I decided
to migrate my project over there.

Why, well I knew I was going to need to use a .tk domain
thus I woulnd't be able to use a full fledge universal website,
so I'd have to settle for a simple static website, a SPA (single page app)

Nuxt was ideal since it generates all the routing 
and views I needed, so less configuring work.

Also nuxt had support for PWA's

Here I also found out that my PWA app would never get 
A great SEO score, partly due to some configuring issues, but also
since I'd be using a .tk domain name anyways.

### Etweb 5-7

This is where my project found a new big turning point.

Again, though I could've just pushed a template 
website, I still wanted to learn new things, so I stumbled upon vuepress.

It has a neat simple blogging feature that was Ideal for 
my project page.

I tried recreating my project page in nuxt, 
though It didn't work out since some of the markdown-it
dependencies were very lackluster in documentation, and there 
were just far too many issues in creating something like that.

So I hopped onto vuepress to create a project page,
basically a feature where it would convert markdown files into readable
html files, and on vuepress it was only the matter of hours 
till i got my first prototype working.

Also, vuepress is static and relatively simple.

The only issue I would have with vuepress, is 
it has it's limitations, and some pathing issues, but those
are problems for another day.

Vuepress also has PWA support, but I decided I'll pass on
the whole PWA feature for now.

Since vuepress has some pathing issues, I coulndn't 
really import any cool fancy styles, and since
this project was dragging for a bit too long I just decided with a simple
design and well here it is.

### The end 

Though this site is pretty lackluster and simple..
well i guess thats the beauty in it.

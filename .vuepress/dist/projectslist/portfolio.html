		ET Portfolio Page
	</h1> <p data-v-07a42d70><a href="https://github.com/EricTalv/etweb7" target="_blank" data-v-07a42d70>Github</a></p> <section class="forImage" data-v-07a42d70><div class="content__default" data-v-07a42d70><p>Welcome to my page!</p> <p>This page was developed over only a couple of days.
The website went through many iterations and design changes,
and thanks to many environmental issues I wasn't as able to create
the astonishing site I really wanted.</p> <p>BUT I assure the beauty lies more in the process of creation
than the websites desing itself.</p> <p>So let me bring you through a brief history of
my portfolio site here</p> <h2 id="etweb-x"><a href="#etweb-x" class="header-anchor">#</a> Etweb_X</h2> <p>I had recently gotten out of the military and since
there was a very lengthy hiatus from programming, I decided
to take it on myself to make a full-fledged website myself.</p> <p>Yeah I could've really just taken any web template,
filled it out and settled with that, though I feard
my knowledge has fallen short so this would be a great opportunity to
refresh myself.</p> <h3 id="etweb-1-2"><a href="#etweb-1-2" class="header-anchor">#</a> Etweb 1-2</h3> <p>So here is where it started,
I already have some background in working with vue
so I decided this is what I was gonna go with.</p> <p>Along the way I picked up some other cool new tech
related things that I wanted to look into such as surge.sh, PWA's and SPA's</p> <p>So not only was I just working on a simple Portfolio site,
i was asynchronously looking into PWA's, SEO's and
other domain-level features.</p> <p>Here there was some simple design work, I
ofcourse went with bootstrap for my css library since
I am somewhat familiar with it.</p> <h3 id="etweb-3-4"><a href="#etweb-3-4" class="header-anchor">#</a> Etweb 3-4</h3> <p>Here I found out that I also used Nuxt so I decided
to migrate my project over there.</p> <p>Why? well I knew I was going to need to use a .tk domain
thus I woulnd't be able to use a full fledge universal website,
so I'd have to settle for a simple static website, a SPA (single page app).</p> <p>Nuxt was ideal since it generates all the routing
and views I needed, so less configuring work.</p> <p>Also nuxt had support for PWA's</p> <p>Here I also found out that my PWA app would never get
A great SEO score, partly due to some configuring issues, but also
since I'd be using a .tk domain name anyways.</p> <h3 id="etweb-5-7"><a href="#etweb-5-7" class="header-anchor">#</a> Etweb 5-7</h3> <p>This is where my project found a new big turning point.</p> <p>Again, though I could've just pushed a template
website, I still wanted to learn new things, so I stumbled upon vuepress.</p> <p>It has a neat simple blogging feature that was Ideal for
my project page.</p> <p>I tried recreating my project page in nuxt,
though It didn't work out since some of the markdown-it
dependencies were very lackluster in documentation, and there
were just far too many issues in creating something like that.</p> <p>So I hopped onto vuepress to create a project page,
basically a feature where it would convert markdown files into readable
html files, and on vuepress it was only the matter of hours
till i got my first prototype working.</p> <p>Also, vuepress is static and relatively simple.</p> <p>The only issue I would have with vuepress, is
it has it's limitations, and some pathing issues, but those
are problems for another day.</p> <p>Vuepress also has PWA support, but I decided I'll pass on
the whole PWA feature for now.</p> <p>Since vuepress has some pathing issues, I coulndn't
really import any cool fancy styles, and since
this project was dragging for a bit too long I just decided with a simple
design and well here it is.</p> <h3 id="the-end"><a href="#the-end" class="header-anchor">#</a> The end</h3> <p>Though this site is pretty lackluster and simple,
Id say its a nice starting point for something bigger and better.</p></div></section></article><div class="global-ui"></div></div>

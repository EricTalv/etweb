		ChatCenter - A Socialising Platform
	</h1> <p data-v-07a42d70><a href="https://github.com/EricTalv/ChatCenterV3" target="_blank" data-v-07a42d70>Github</a></p> <section class="forImage" data-v-07a42d70><div class="content__default" data-v-07a42d70><p>ChatCenter is my ambitious project in creating an elaborate socialising platform
with many different types of features.</p> <h2 id="inspiration"><a href="#inspiration" class="header-anchor">#</a> Inspiration</h2> <p>I got inspired by the website called Omegle.com, basically the idea of
just chatting to strangers in an environment which is
somewhat controlled and safe.</p> <p>Pretty much going against what mom told us
and still chatting to strangers.</p> <p>What really inspired me was what omegle was missing.</p> <p>You pretty much only have 2 features, with an interface
thats way behind its time and clearly a lacking
proper development team, the site requires a serious revamp
and definitely some extra features.</p> <p>Thus was my project called &quot;ChatCenter&quot;- born.</p> <h2 id="how-would-it-differ"><a href="#how-would-it-differ" class="header-anchor">#</a> How would it differ?</h2> <p>I've always had an interest towards telemetry and web communications,
have you ever wondered how ALL of this actually works?
How you can send a message in the matter of milliseconds to someone
on the other side of the earth?</p> <p>Well curiousity of how it works is one thing, in my case,
my curiosity developed into something more, specifically:</p> <p>How far can we push it?</p> <p>How far could we push our communication methods and what fun and
exciting things we could manage to do with it.</p> <p>I had many different features in planned for the website, ranging from
a visual game like area to other maybe not so practical features.</p> <h2 id="along-the-way"><a href="#along-the-way" class="header-anchor">#</a> Along the way</h2> <p>I added this section because my Ideas tend to start as small
yarn balls and end up bigger and bigger within moments.</p> <p>Though my ambitious project initially revolved around web communication,
I decided that I reaaally wanted to have an admin panel, a blog, an easy development environment.</p> <p>Basically, since I have a somewhat of a control freak mindset,
I wanted all the customizability that I neede, so in the future
It would be much easier to push in a feature from the admin panel,
than just diving into the code to write it.</p> <p>This was waaay out of my boundries of knowledge, I was
basically about to create my own type of CMS, so I decided
Ill just add a blogging feature where I can update whats happening
on the site, and add a neat little markdown admin panel where I
can manage my posts.</p> <p>Though that wasn't easier, It still took a huge load of time.</p> <p>So basically I ended up with kind of two projects:</p> <ol><li><p>Create a feature packed socialising website</p></li> <li><p>Create an easily managable blogging platform</p></li></ol> <p>Well long story short, I got as far as adding posts and
retrieving them from the database, but my socialising part never
went as far from my Express prototype</p> <h2 id="the-future"><a href="#the-future" class="header-anchor">#</a> The future</h2> <p>I definitely still want to work on the product, but right now
I feel like I don't have the the amount of vocabulary that
I would need to create such a project.</p></div></section></article><div class="global-ui"></div></div>

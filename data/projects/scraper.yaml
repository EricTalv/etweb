  - subdescription:  >
                      This was a request from a client at my internship.
                      The request was to create a very verbous email scraper.

                      I started off with C# but quickly found out it wasn't cut out for the job so I settled with Python and its wide variety of libraries  

  - subtitle: Challenges
  - subdescription:  >
                      As mentioned I started in making the project in C# but C# couldn't handle a lot of different websites thus I had to create countless amounts of rules and bypasses for It to even digest a proper page, since websites come in all kinds of forms whether pre-rendered, static or whatever other sorts.


                      In python I had to do some rules for finding specific rules, doing multiple tasks at once and also for it to black-list certain bigger sites.

                      The program turned out rather successful, it did what it had to do and additionally I added my zest in simple usability and color.

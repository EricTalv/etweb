                      This was at my Internship and as per-request, was to re-vamp their trenet.eu website as a whole.


                      Their website was on an old PhpMyAdmin system thus was vulnerable for security faults and also overall was just an aged webpage, they wanted a new fresh design remake of the site.

                      Since they wanted a secure site and they didn't use any blogging or constant changes to their website, we decided to use *Hugo static web-generator* for the front-end framework. 


                      Additionally I used Adobe Photoshop to revamp their logo from an old *.gif* logo to a new and improved *.svg*


                      They wanted an emailing widget, so I decided to create a google-forms type of script integrated to the html form.

                      I decided to use a pre-made template for the site, but had to heavily modify all of the internal scaffolding to fit all of the content.


                      There was a lot of fitting and puzzling each widget into their own place. 


                      The emailing feature I wanted to design as to be proof of any web-scrapers to steal their email and be simple and easy to use.

                      The staff of the firm really liked the website, but the website isnt quite yet deployed due to some administrative issues on their side.

                      So since I loved creating C# windows-forms apps (to an extent) I thought i'd list a couple of my more prized C# projects from my school!

                      [***Main Menu***](https://github.com/EricTalv/Main-Menu-Example-1) 


                      This is my prized possesion.


                      Our course rarely focused on software design which frustrated me, since most of the times the UX would be immensly lackluster and dull but to me these two were fundamental features for anytype of product.


                      So I decided to create my own intuitive main menu design.


                      The beauty doesnt inheritly lie in its colors and well the "Design" aspect, rather the beauty is in the layout and the user experience.


                      It is very simple to choose a category and see what exactly is available in them, and additionally a description of what exactly is talked about.


                      This allowed me to categorize many of my projects and add more meaning to them, not just throw them in an archive folder as many do.


                      [***Hangman Game***](https://github.com/EricTalv/HangManGame)


                      This is was a fun project.


                      The task was to create a simple hangman game, that would read word from your given file and generate a Hangman type of game.


                      ***[Dynamic Button Creation Environment](https://github.com/EricTalv/ButtonCreation)***


                      One day I was extremely fed up with dynamically adding elements to the software load screen, so I decided to create my own button adding environment.


                      This was all for myself, so I could simplify and understand how elements would be placed with different methods.


                      *[**Picture Altering***](https://github.com/EricTalv/PictureAltering)


                      The task was to create a program that would take an image and alter it in specific ways.


                      I looked at many different approaches of altering images, such as converting the image into a diamond shape, circle and triangle.

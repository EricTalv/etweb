                      This was a request by my schools film-club.
                      The request was to create a Jeopardy type game, where they can freely add their content and it will generate the game for them.

                      I decided to use C# for I was familiar with it the most at the time.

                      There were many things to take into account, I cut the project into two:


                       1. The game itself
                       2. Game creation


                      I needed a simple method of creating jeopardy games, with a simple interface, so I decided .ini files would do the trick, basically the creation screen was just a lot of labels and input-boxes, that would later write into a .ini file, on paper it sounds simple but in C# it was quite a hassle.

                      As for the game, there went a lot of calculation into making the game grid properly fit, there were also issues with font fitting, and occasionally those issues still exist.

                      The game came out well enough for the film-clubs standards and has been used multiple times on air.

                      Since I have a very ambitious mind, I wanted to add different kinds of features but due to a hectic school life at the time, I never got to them.

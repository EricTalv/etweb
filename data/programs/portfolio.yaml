                      Here I'll address this site and how the development process led up to this point.


                      If you wish you can read the longer, more detailed version of this, then the readme can be found on the github page.


                      My portfolio has gone through about 8 different iterations now and definitely has yet to see the end of itself.

                      Along the way I dabbled in *vue.js, nuxt.js, vuepress, bootstrap* and *hugo*

                      I'd say I was the bigger challenge in creating this site, my ambitions lie very high thus I was blowing this sites design way out of proportion.

                      Crafting a lot of the logic behind, converting .md to html files and fiddling around with bootstrap and my own design choices would take most of the time.

                      As of right now, I have resulted in creating 8 different iterations of this site and am still looking for different ways of making it even better.

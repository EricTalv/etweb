                     This client wanted a very simplre vevamp to their website.
                     Previously they had an older outdated version, thus 
                     they wanted a little more modern type website.


                     They wanted to have the integrity of the website 
                     to stay the same so I decided to just go with a simple 
                     minimal design.

                     At the end the site came out pretty good.
